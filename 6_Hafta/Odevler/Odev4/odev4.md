## Question 1
The convention for naming a generic type is usually a single uppercase letter. The most common one used is `<T>`.

So the answers are:

- [x] <T>
- [ ] <Gen>
- [ ] <Generic>
- [ ] <X>

## Question 2
A restriction on the types allowed for a generic type is called a generic constraint.

So the answers are:

- [ ] a generic restriction
- [x] a generic constraint
- [ ] disambiguation
- [ ] a generic type limit

## Question 3
Reified means the generic type parameter has been made into a real type.

So the answers are:

- [ ] The real execution impact of an object has been calculated.
- [ ] A restricted entry index has been set on the class.
- [x] The generic type parameter has been made into a real type.
- [ ] A remote error indicator has been triggered.
